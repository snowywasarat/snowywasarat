- 👋 Hi, I’m @snowywasarat
- 👀 I’m interested in Home Assitant
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to integrate products into the app that have no automatic recognition
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Energenie Mihome, Dahua, Texecom, PureDrive (solar battery)- I have zero coding experience and as a retiree, this is an adventure I need to take slowly. I have used Google Home but the voice recignition and constant 'back-chat' about devices it can't reach, even when its changed their status as instructed, is leading me to find alternaives which I hope to find here.
- 📫 How to reach me snowywasarat@gmail.com
